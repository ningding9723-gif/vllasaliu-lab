<h1>Research</h1>

<p>
The Vllasaliu Lab focuses on understanding and overcoming biological barriers 
to enable injection-free delivery of biotherapeutics. Our research integrates 
nanomedicine, extracellular vesicle engineering, intestinal biology and 
translational drug delivery science to improve patient access to medicines.
</p>

<h2>Extracellular Vesicles & RNA Delivery</h2>

<p>
We investigate naturally derived and engineered extracellular vesicles (EVs) 
as delivery systems for nucleic acid therapeutics. Our work explores 
EV–cell interactions, endocytosis pathways and biodistribution mechanisms 
to enable efficient oral and mucosal RNA delivery.
</p>

<p>
A major focus of the group is the development of hybrid EV–nanoparticle systems 
that combine the biological functionality of EVs with the engineering precision 
of lipid nanoparticles. These platforms aim to enhance stability, targeting 
and epithelial barrier penetration.
</p>

<h2>Nanomedicine & Lipid-Based Drug Delivery</h2>

<p>
We design and characterise lipid nanoparticles and hybrid nanocarriers 
to overcome epithelial and mucosal barriers. Our research integrates 
physicochemical optimisation, cellular transport studies and mechanistic 
analysis of nanoparticle uptake and trafficking.
</p>

<p>
Particular emphasis is placed on oral delivery strategies, including 
understanding particle interaction with mucus, intestinal epithelial cells 
and inflammatory microenvironments.
</p>

<h2>Injection-Free Biotherapeutics</h2>

<p>
The overarching aim of the lab is to enable non-invasive administration 
of peptides, proteins and nucleic acids. By combining advanced formulation 
approaches with mechanistic biological insight, we aim to reduce reliance 
on injectable therapies.
</p>

<p>
This work has strong translational potential and is supported through 
collaborations with pharmaceutical industry partners and UKRI-funded projects.
</p>

<h2>Advanced In Vitro & Organoid Models</h2>

<p>
We develop predictive in vitro models, including co-culture systems and 
organoid-derived epithelial layers, to better understand biological barriers 
and improve translational relevance in drug delivery research.
</p>

<p>
These models enable mechanistic investigation of transport pathways, 
inflammatory modulation and nanoparticle–cell interactions.
